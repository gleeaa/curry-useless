# THICCURRY üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Kope


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Ajmal P K -LBSCEK
- Member 2: Fathima Basheer MTP -LBSCEK

### Project Description
A computer vision tool that analyzes curry thickness as a precise percentage (0-100%) by measuring oil separation, surface reflections, and texture density.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever stared at a pot of curry, spoon in hand, wondering: 'Is this thick enough?' Your guests are hungry, but your anxiety is thicker than the sauce. What if you could measure curry viscosity like a pro chef, without 10 years of cooking experience?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A stupidly simple tool that scans your curry and spits out a thickness percentage (0-100%). No PhD in sauce physics required, just point your phone and get an instant number. Finally, settle the 'Is this gravy or soup?' debate with cold, hard data.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Python
- Oil Slick Detector‚Ñ¢ (HSV color masking)

Glossy Surface Meter‚Ñ¢ (pixel reflection analysis)

Blob Theory‚Ñ¢ (texture granularity scoring)

- OpenCV
- VSCode, Chatgpt, Deepseek, and some fresh air.

For Hardware:
- Webcam

### Implementation
For Software:

# Installation (one-time)
pip install opencv-python numpy

# Run (live camera analysis only - no storage)
python main.py

# Real-Time Curry Thickness Analyzer

## Features
- üì∑ Live camera analysis only (no images/videos stored)
- ‚ö° Instant thickness percentage (0-100%)
- üîç Processes frames in real-time
- üö´ Zero storage - no data saved

## Usage
1. Connect any camera (webcam/phone/IP cam)
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
